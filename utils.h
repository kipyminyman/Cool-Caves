/**
 * Binds the buffer, gets (and ultimately returns) the attribute `name` in
 * `shader_program`. Then, the attribute is set up according to the provided
 * specs. See man pages on glVertexAttribPointer for more details.
 *
 * NOTE: if `type` is GL_FLOAT or `normalized` is GL_TRUE, then
 * glVertexAttribPointer will be used. If `type` is GL_DOUBLE, then
 * glVertexAttribLPointer is used. Otherwise, glVertexAttribIPointer is used.
 *
 * NOTE: It is assumed that the passed buffer is to be bound to GL_ARRAY_BUFFER,
 * as this function is specifically used to set up vertex attributes.
 *
 * @param  buffer     Specifies the name of a buffer object.
 * @param  program    Specifies the program object to be queried.
 * @param  name       Points to a null terminated string containing the name of
 *                    the attribute variable whose location is to be queried.
 * @param  size       Specifies the number of components per generic vertex
 *                    attribute. Must be 1, 2, 3, 4. Additionally, the symbolic
 *                    constant GL_BGRA is accepted by glVertexAttribPointer. The
 *                    initial value is 4.
 * @param  type       Specifies the data type of each component in the array.
 *                    See opengl docs on glVertexAttribPointer for more details.
 * @param  stride     Specifies the byte offset between consecutive generic
 *                    vertex attributes. If stride is 0, the generic vertex
 *                    attributes are understood to be tightly packed in the array.
 * @param  pointer    Specifies a offset of the first component of the first
 *                    generic vertex attribute in the array in the data store of
 *                    the buffer currently bound to the GL_ARRAY_BUFFER target.
 *                    To put it simply, this is the initial offset of the buffer.
 * @param  normalized For glVertexAttribPointer, specifies whether fixed-point
 *                    data values should be normalized (GL_TRUE) or converted
 *                    directly as fixed-point values (GL_FALSE) when they are
 *                    accessed. Note: this is only used when you want to use
 *                    glVertexAttribPointer.
 * @return            Same as the return of `glGetAttribLocation(program, name)`
 *                    Returns the location of an attribute variable.
